# Parallax Podcast (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal scaffold for a mobile-first Parallax Podcast app built with Vite, React and Tailwind.

How to run (Windows cmd):

1. Install dependencies

```cmd
cd parallax-app
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Notes
- The mock data is in `src/api/mock/cards.json`. The sample audio references a file in the parent repo `../src/m4a/...` — you may need to adjust paths depending on how you serve static assets.
- Tailwind is configured; ensure `npm install` completes before running.
